Please run 
python main.py 

Python version must be 3.7 or above but below 3.11

Please install the required depencies in requirements.txt by using 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
If there are still problems it is probably due to the package versions being different
So must use pip install packagename==version --upgrade
Enjoy the app! :)
